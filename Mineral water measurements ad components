The best minerals for drinking water and their recommended measurements are:

1. Calcium: 50-100 mg/L (milligrams per liter)
2. Magnesium: 20-50 mg/L
3. Potassium: 1-5 mg/L
4. Sodium: 10-50 mg/L
5. Zinc: 0.5-1.5 mg/L
6. Iron: 0.1-1.0 mg/L
7. Manganese: 0.1-1.0 mg/L
8. Copper: 0.01-1.0 mg/L
9. Phosphorus: 10-50 mg/L
10. Bicarbonate (HCO3): 100-200 mg/L
11. Sulfate (SO4): 50-150 mg/L
12. Chloride (Cl): 50-150 mg/L
13. Silica (SiO2): 10-50 mg/L

Note: These measurements are general guidelines and may vary depending on individual needs and circumstances.

Having the right balance of minerals in drinking water is important for maintaining good health. Minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium help regulate fluid balance and blood pressure, while zinc, iron, and manganese support immune function and antioxidant defenses.

It's worth noting that the ideal mineral content may vary depending on factors like age, sex, and activity level. Additionally, the quality of the water source and treatment process can affect the mineral content. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations.
