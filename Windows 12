Windows 12 is not officially announced by Microsoft yet, and there's no release date confirmed. However, there are rumors and speculations circulating online. Some sources suggest that Windows 12 might be released in late 2024 or early 2025, but these claims are not verified ¹.
It's also important to note that any downloadable versions of Windows 12 available online are likely scams or malware, as Microsoft has not released any official ISO files for Windows 12 ².
As for the system requirements, there are rumors that Windows 12 might require higher specs than Windows 11, including a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for AI-related features. However, these requirements are not confirmed, and it's unclear whether Microsoft will make NPU a mandatory requirement ¹.To stay updated on the latest news and announcements about Windows 12, I recommend keeping an eye on the official Microsoft Windows blog ¹.
