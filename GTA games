The first Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game was released on October 21, 1997, for the PlayStation and PC. However, the concept and development of GTA began earlier.

The idea for GTA was conceived in 1995 by David Jones, a Scottish video game designer, and his company, DMA Design (now known as Rockstar North). Jones wanted to create a game that allowed players to explore a 3D city and engage in criminal activities.

The development of GTA began in 1996, and the game was initially titled "Race 'n' Chase." However, the title was later changed to Grand Theft Auto, inspired by the 1950s-60s American slang term "grand theft auto," which referred to the theft of high-value vehicles.

After two years of development, the first GTA game was released in 1997, marking the beginning of the iconic series. Since then, the series has grown to become one of the most successful and influential in the gaming industry.
